# Time-Series-Analysis-Zillow-Data

## Project Description
## Overview / Background 
In the competitive world of real estate investment, making informed decisions is crucial for maximizing returns and minimizing risks. The real estate market is influenced by numerous factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, and local market dynamics. For a fictional real-estate investment firm looking to expand its portfolio, identifying the most promising zip codes for investment requires a data-driven approach. This project aims to analyze historical housing data to identify trends and patterns that can inform investment decisions. By developing a predictive model, we aim to forecast future returns on investment (ROI) for different zip codes, providing valuable insights for prospective investors.

# Problem Statement
The real estate market is experiencing unpredictable fluctuations in property prices. This uncertainty makes it difficult for prospective investors to make informed decisions about investing in property. The company needs to find an informed way to decide on which properties to invest in.

# Objectives

1. To analyze the zillow housing dataset, identify key patterns, trends and relatioships in the data and yeild visualizations that will aid in data-driven decisions.
2. To develop a predictive timeseries model that will forecast return on investment(ROI) of the various Zip codes.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from Zillow Research, a leading real estate and rental marketplace. The dataset includes historical housing data for 147 zip codes in the United States, spanning the years 1996 to 2018. The dataset contains information on median home prices, rental prices, and housing sales volume for each zip code. The data is organized in a wide format, with each row representing a unique zip code and each column representing a specific year. The dataset also includes metadata on the location and population of each zip code, providing additional context for the analysis.

## Data Understanding
The dataset consists of various columns including region information and monthly real estate prices from April 1996 to April 2018. 
The columns are:
- RegionID: Identifier for the region
- RegionName: Zip code
- City: City name
